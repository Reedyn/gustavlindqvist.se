[Well that escalated quickly!](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Well+that+escalated+quickly+meme&t=ffab&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images){.lead}

I gave up even trying to keep up with all the replies but I felt I had to do some kind of summary when it all cooled down a bit. [The post](https://jkpg.rocks/@gustav/111488570537867130) was reblogged 243 times and got over 300 replies. I went through all replies and compiled this list of all movies that got recommended. If I missed some, let me know!

## The list

<p>Updated <date datetime="2023-11-30T18:37:44+0100" title="2023-11-30 18:37">30 november</date>. <a href="https://jkpg.rocks/@gustav/111488570537867130">See original post</a> for possibly more replies after this date.</p>

I included a link to the post if it was posted as public (not unlisted or private) but I counted them all in the summary regardless of post visibility. Some seemed ambivalent whether they recommended a movie or not, I didn't count those.
